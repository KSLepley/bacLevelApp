- `stop` - Stop monitoring
- `add <drink>` - Add a drink (beer/wine/liquor/cocktail)
- `status` - Show current status
- `chart` - Show real-time chart
- `gauge` - Show BAC gauge
- `reset` - Reset session
- `quit` - Exit program

## üî¨ Technical Details

### BAC Calculation Methods

1. **Widmark Formula**
   ```
   BAC = (A / (r * W)) - (Œ≤ * t)
   ```
   Where:
   - A = total alcohol consumed (grams)
   - r = Widmark factor (0.68 for males, 0.55 for females)
   - W = body weight (grams)
   - Œ≤ = alcohol elimination rate (0.015 per hour)
   - t = time since first drink (hours)

2. **Sensor-Based Estimation**
   - Heart rate monitoring
   - Skin conductance measurement
   - Temperature tracking
   - Baseline comparison algorithms

### Sensor Simulation

The system simulates wearable device sensors:
- **Heart Rate**: Baseline 70 BPM, increases with alcohol
- **Skin Conductance**: Baseline 5.0 ŒºS, increases with alcohol
- **Temperature**: Baseline 98.6¬∞F, affected by alcohol

### Alert Thresholds

- **Warning**: BAC ‚â• 0.05 (0.05%)
- **Danger**: BAC ‚â• 0.08 (0.08%) - Legal driving limit
- **Critical**: BAC ‚â• 0.15 (0.15%)

## üìä BAC Effects Reference

| BAC Level | Status | Effects | Recommendation |
|-----------|--------|---------|----------------|
| < 0.02 | Sober | No significant effects | Safe to drive |
| 0.02-0.05 | Mild Impairment | Slight euphoria, relaxation | Exercise caution |
| 0.05-0.08 | Moderate Impairment | Impaired judgment, reduced coordination | Do not drive |
| 0.08-0.15 | High Impairment | Significant impairment, poor coordination | Seek safe transportation |
| > 0.15 | Severe Impairment | Severe impairment, risk of alcohol poisoning | Seek medical attention |
